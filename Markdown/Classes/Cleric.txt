You have an Undead servant, a creature previously alive whose soul you are forcing to stay in this world against its will and do your bidding.
Come up with a story about why you have an Undead servant, and why your god allowed this or gave him or her to you.
_For example, your servant was in a group of cultists who killed your family. Now, your god gave you the power to resurrect one of these cultists to aid you in killing the rest of the cult._
Your servant must follow your orders as long as it is related to the reason you are forcing it to stay.
The servant must be a sentient humanoid and must be within 15 meters of you at all time, otherwise it will permanently lose 1 Maximum health for each hour spent apart.
It has the following stats:
 Health: 1/3 of your maximum health
 Armor: Same as yours, but -1
 Stats: All 0, except one which is 2 (you choose which).
 Movement: 5 meters
 Initiative: Always equal to yours, and takes its turn before or after you (you choose every time).
 It can use 1 Action to make a melee attack on its turn: +3 to hit, 1d8 Force or Necrotic damage
The servant can take 0.5 Actions, but only for simple, non-combat tasks.
In addition, when getting your servant, choose one of the following abilities for it:
	[Marksmanship] : Passive
	The servant can shoot a bow, crossbow or any other ranged weapon.
	Its attacks have up to 6 meters range.

	[Maneuverist] : Passive
	Your servant knows two Maneuvers from the Maneuver List which take 1 Action.
Same rules for Resting/Long Resting/Death apply to your servant as to Heroes, and your servant is treated as a Hero for ability purposes.
If the servant really dies, it is released from this world.
Tip: Just because he or she is your servant, that doesn't mean you should treat him or her as a pet or a slave. Think of creative ways to build the relationship between you and your servant.
