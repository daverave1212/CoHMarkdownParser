#Race#
	Orc	// VARIANT: Ogre (lot of hp, 4 ms)
Tribal in nature, though not stupid. Orc societies are highly based on honor and strength. Many orcs are also in tune with nature or spirits, allowing them to be both powerful and cunning. Unlike orcs in traditional fantasy, Orcs in Call of Heroes are not necessarily vile and reckless. Orcs are leaders and hunters by nature, but will also be lead by someone stronger or who can indeed lead better than them. Even in a more peaceful tribe, the most charismatic, witty and strong orc will be the leader. Orcs are also driven by control (over territory, goods, etc). Many of them wish to be in control: they don't like other people doing things for them, unless they are sure they can do it better. For this reason, many orcs make a living without help. They build their own houses, hunt their own food or pillage for both the good of the tribe and their own.
