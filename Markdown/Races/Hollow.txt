	Hollow
Hollows are revenants of people who suffered an unworthy or untimely death and who's job as a mortal is not finished.
Like a ghost, a Hollow's pursuit is so strong that their soul refused to leave the mortal plane, and has come back into their own body to finish what they started.
A hollow is an undead, yet not considered necessarily unholy.
As a Hollow, you might have been revived by the god you follow, or simply your feeling of purpose was so strong that your soul did not leave your body when you died.
A Hollow always has a goal, usually started when they were alive. Or, you might have gotten your goal when you died, such as exacting revenge on the person who killed you.
Most of the time, hollows are devoid of emotions. Many common emotions they used to have are now numbed.
They might retain emotions they particularily had when they were alive, such as love (if, for example, they had someone they loved very much).
The primary emotion they feel is the one that drives them to their goal.
In following their goal, a Hollow might be unusually hopeful or perseverent.
The worst emotions a hollow can feel are uselessness and hopelessness.
Sometimes, being hollow comes with partial amnesia. A Hollow might forget certain aspects of their past life, such as forgetting some skills or who some people were, where they lived, sometimes even what their name is, in which case a Hollow will come up with a name to represent them, based on what they know.
After achieving their goal, a hollow usually feels complete, unless another goal arises.
Then, it's the Hollow's choice what it wants to do: roam until their body becomes too rotten to continue and finally release their soul, or kill themselves, as their life's purpose was fulfilled.
